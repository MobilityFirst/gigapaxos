# Declaring service properties for XDN

!!! tip "Declarative Replication"
    XDN embraces declarative replication, relieving the app developers to know in detail **how** the replication happen.
    Developers only need to declare the **what**, specifically the service and its operations properties: whether it is
    deterministic or not, set of commutative operations, nil-external operations, read-only operations etc; and the 
    intended consistency model.

## Determinism
## Nil-external operations
## Commutative operations
## Monotonic operations
